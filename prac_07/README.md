## Lessons Learned about Clean Code
- Writing code that is clear and straightforward helps others understand the code more easily. Simple and concise code is easier to maintain and less prone to bugs.
- Using descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes enhances the readability of the code. Good names help convey the purpose and use of various code elements.
-  Breaking down code into smaller, reusable functions and avoiding code duplication makes it easier to maintain and test. This practice aligns with the DRY principle, promoting efficient and organized code.
